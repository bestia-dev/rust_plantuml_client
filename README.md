## Motivation

It is very ofter needed to insert simple graphs inside the README markdown file of Rust projects.
There is a lot of different ways to do that.
I prefer to use <http://plantuml.com> server to render the graph from a simple text file.
Then I save the resulting SVG file in the `image` directory and add it to README.md as an image.
This is easy to do manually, but for me every problem needs a software solution.
So I want to make an automation task for this.
But first I need a simple Rust library or CLI app to call the <plantuml.com> server and save the image.
This web service API is pretty non-standard because the plantuml code needs to be compressed and base64 in an unusual way.
This `Rust plantuml client` will solve this. It can be used as a Rust library or as a standalone CLI app.

## Try it
